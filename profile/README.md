## Hello there 👋 

# Welcome to the Quantum Plasmas @IST GitHub Organization!

We are a group of researchers and students of [Instituto Superior Técnico - Universidade de Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/) studying the field of quantum plasmas.

This page is dedicated to the study of quantum plasmas, a fascinating and rapidly evolving field of research that lies at the intersection of plasma physics and quantum mechanics. Quantum plasmas are plasmas in which the effects of quantum mechanics play a significant role, leading to a wide range of novel and often counterintuitive phenomena.

In here, you'll find a variety of resources related to the study of quantum plasmas, including:

- Code for simulating quantum plasmas using a variety of numerical techniques
- Data from experiments and simulations of quantum plasmas
- Discussion forums for sharing ideas and collaborating with other researchers

Our goal is to create a vibrant and active community of researchers interested in the study of quantum plasmas. Whether you're an experienced researcher or just starting out, we invite you to join us and contribute to this exciting and rapidly growing field.

To get started, take a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/QuantumPlasmas-IST/.github/wikihttps://github.com/QuantumPlasmas-IST/.github/wiki) for an introduction to quantum plasmas, or check out some of the code in our [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/QuantumPlasmas-IST/repositories) to see what we are working on.

We look forward to working with you and exploring the fascinating world of quantum plasmas together!

### Topics 

At the present time, our main lines of research are:

 - Solid-state plasmas: In solid-state plasmas, electrons are typically confined to a crystal lattice and can interact with one another through the lattice vibrations. At low temperatures, the electrons can exhibit quantum mechanical behavior, and the interaction between the electrons and the lattice vibrations can give rise to collective excitations known as plasmons. These plasmons behave similarly to the collective plasma oscillations observed in traditional plasmas.

- Cold gas systems: In cold gas systems, ultra-cold neutral atoms can be ionized to create a plasma. At these low temperatures, the plasma can exhibit quantum mechanical behavior, and the interaction between the charged particles can lead to the formation of complex structures such as vortices, turbulence, and even crystalline phases.

- Bose-Einstein condensates: A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter in which a group of identical particles, typically bosons, are cooled to a very low temperature, causing them to enter the same quantum state. In a plasma context, a BEC can be created by cooling the charged particles to a low temperature and confining them in a trap. In this regime, the charged particles can exhibit collective behavior, such as plasma oscillations, that are strongly influenced by quantum mechanical effects.

- Fluids of light: A fluid of light, also known as a photon fluid, is a system in which a large number of photons are confined in a small volume, typically using a cavity or waveguide. At high photon densities, the photons can interact with one another to give rise to collective behavior that is similar to that observed in traditional plasmas. The behavior of the photons can be strongly influenced by quantum mechanical effects, such as photon entanglement and quantum tunneling.

In general, these systems exhibit behavior that is strongly influenced by quantum mechanical effects. The study of these systems falls under the broader umbrella of quantum plasmas and has important implications for a variety of fields, including condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and plasma physics.
